			"This board has no marking on the front side, only something that looks like PCB manufacturing info on the back; thus it was named based on these symbols.",
			"It can be found in 'LSC Smart Connect Outdoor LED Strip', and is likely custom-made for this product.",
			"The pinout was established by writing to and probing consecutive GPIOs, using the generic board definition.",
