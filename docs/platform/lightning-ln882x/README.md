LN882x has two UART ports - The UART0 port is used for flashing and text output.

You need to find which pins correspond to UART0 TX and RX. If your board is supported, you'll find the pinout on its documentation page. Otherwise (and for generic boards), you'll have to find the pinout online.

### Wiring

Connect UART0 of the LN882H to the USB-TTL adapter:

PC  | LN882H
----|-----------------------
RX  | TX0 (GPIOA2 / P2)
TX  | RX0 (GPIOA3 / P3)
GND | GND

The download mode is entered when the chip communicates with the flasher program. Hence, the first step is running the flasher program (described below). While the program is trying to establish communication, **the chip has to be rebooted**. In order to do that, you need to bridge BOOT1 pin to GND with a wire **before** powering the chip.

After linking with the chip, the flasher program will begin writing (or reading) the firmware automatically. If that doesn't happen, try resetting the chip again until it works.

If you're getting a `No response received` (or similar) error, this means that:

- the power supply is too weak (read above)
- you're resetting the chip too quickly, i.e. you resetted it *after* the program started communicating with it

### Flashing

Since `ltchiptool` does't support flashing yet, use the official command-line [flashing tool](https://gitee.com/lightningsemi/ln882h-document-collection/blob/master/4.%E7%83%A7%E5%BD%95%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7/%E4%B8%B2%E5%8F%A3%E7%83%A7%E5%BD%95/LN882H%E5%91%BD%E4%BB%A4%E8%A1%8C%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7_V1.0.16.zip)

Examples:
`LN882H_CMD_Tool.exe COM1 download flash 921600 0x0 image_firmware.bin`

## Firmware output files

These files are present in the build directory after successful compilation:

File                            | Description
--------------------------------|----------------------------------------
**image_firmware.bin**          | **Binary image for UART upload** - flashable at 0x0
**firmware.uf2**                | **UF2 package for OTA upload**
image_firmware-ota-xz-v1.0.bin  | Binary OTA package - not for flashing directly
