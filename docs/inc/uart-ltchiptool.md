## Using ltchiptool (wired, via UART)

You can use the [ltchiptool](../flashing/tools/ltchiptool.md) GUI or CLI to manually flash the firmware. Grab the `firmware.uf2` file from the build directory. Then, follow the [ltchiptool usage guide](../flashing/tools/ltchiptool.md) to flash it to the device.

!!! tip
	The UF2 file may have a different name, depending on the project you're building. Usually it's best to grab the latest (sorted by date) file with UF2 extension from the build directory.
